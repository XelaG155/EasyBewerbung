# Matching Story Instructions

The "story" attached to each matching score must help candidates overcome potential concerns from ATS filters, HR, and hiring managers.

Key principles:
- **Overqualified applicants (e.g., senior leaders applying to mid-level roles):** Provide a respectful, positive rationale for stepping into the role without criticizing current employers or managers. Emphasize motivations such as mentoring, quick impact, stability, or returning to hands-on work.
- **Career shifters or applicants with non-matching titles/experience:** Highlight transferable skills, concrete achievements, and credible motivations that make the transition believable and reassuring for decision-makers.
- **Tone and goal:** The narrative should be concise, constructive, and geared toward equipping the candidate with talking points that reduce doubts across the recruiting funnel.
